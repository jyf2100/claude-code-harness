Formatting rules applied when creating GitHub Release notes.

## Required Format

### Structure

```markdown
## What's Changed

**One-line description of the change's value**

### Before / After

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Previous state | New state |
| ... | ... |

---

## Added

- **Feature name**: Description
  - Detail 1
  - Detail 2

## Changed

- **Change**: Description

## Fixed

- **Fix**: Description

## Requirements (if applicable)

- **Claude Code vX.X.X+** (recommended)
- Link: [Documentation](URL)

---

Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
```

### Required Elements

| Element | Required | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `## What's Changed` | Yes | Section heading |
| **Bold summary** | Yes | One-line value description |
| `Before / After` table | Yes | User-facing changes |
| `Added/Changed/Fixed` | When applicable | Detailed changes |
| Footer | Yes | `Generated with [Claude Code](...)` |

### Language

- **English required** for all release notes
- Use `Before / After` format with table
- Keep descriptions concise and user-focused

## Prohibited

- No skipping the Before / After table
- No skipping the footer
- No technical-only descriptions (user perspective required)
- No bare change lists without value explanation
- No Japanese in release notes

## Good Example

```markdown
## What's Changed

**`/work --full` now automates implement -> self-review -> improve -> commit in parallel**

### Before / After

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `/work` executes tasks one at a time | `/work --full --parallel 3` runs in parallel |
| Reviews required separate manual step | Each task-worker self-reviews autonomously |
```

## Bad Example

```markdown
## What's New

### Added
- Added task-worker.md
- Added --full option
```

-> Doesn't communicate user value

## Release Creation Command

```bash
gh release create vX.X.X \
  --title "vX.X.X - Title" \
  --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
## What's Changed
...
EOF
)"
```

## Editing Past Releases

```bash
gh release edit vX.X.X --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
...
EOF
)"
```

## Reference

- Good examples: v2.8.0, v2.8.2, v2.9.1
- Keep consistent with CHANGELOG
